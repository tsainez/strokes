# Strokes
Strokes is a simple iOS application that lets users practice the correct stroke orders for certain Chinese characters. This application was created as part of a senior project done at Dr. TJ Owens Gilroy Early College Academy. This Github repository hosts all the source code as well as the development process for the product of that project. This product was created with several months worth of research done in mind.

## Features
This application seeks to deliver the utmost utility to the user without sacrificing any aesthetics. 
- Search for any Chinese character, traditional or simplified, and practice writing the stroke order of that character.

##  Design Philosophy
Taken from the [research essay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwgbuK-8-ppUrBhht5tVHbNseRh-REsJ3P_DQm03PIM/edit?usp=sharing) on Chinese writing systems and the philosophies that Chinese as a foreign language teachers employ,

> For the most part, there are four popular teaching philosophies that teachers tend to subscribe to. Each method has its own upsides and downsides. The first philosophy relies on teaching high frequency Hanzi, or commonly encountered characters (Wang 4). This approach is useful because it would teach speakers words that would be most pertinent to them in everyday speech and reading. Though, a huge flaw with this method is that it relies nearly entirely on rote memorization, and therefore does not tend to foster a healthy understanding of semantic relationships between words. 


>The second philosophy would be to prioritize learning radicals. Radicals are semantic indicators in Chinese characters, meaning they give readers clues as to what the meaning might be. For instance, the radical 氵 closely resembles three drops of water, and this is reflected in words that feature this radical. Some example words that include this radical are: 河, meaning river, or 海, meaning ocean. This approach is useful for several reasons. Firstly, radicals and the number of strokes is how traditional chinese dictionaries are sorted (Wang 4). Secondly, because this approach encourages a healthy understanding of semantic relationships between words. Supposedly, if a learner were to encounter an unfamiliar word, they may be able to derive its meaning through analyzing radicals that are familiar. In conjunction with context clues, this could potentially foster the acquisition of a larger vocabulary faster. However, some flaws with this method are that many characters in related radical series are not high-frequency words or morphemes (sounds), so they are rarely used in real-life contexts and thus not reinforced and easily forgotten (4).


>The third approach would be to stress the phonetic indicators in high frequency characters. The intent of this approach is similar to the previous methods in that it would provide learners a variety of high frequency characters to go off of, and, upon encountering unfamiliar words, learners could utilize previous knowledge to fill in the gaps. However, this approach has yet to be studied deeply, so the results of this approach are somewhat indeterminate (Wang 5). 


>The fourth and final approach is somewhat paradoxical. Some teachers opt to not teach Hanzi whatsoever, believing that “hanzi must be internalized by learners themselves, a task that must be tackled through individual effort and rote memorization,” (Wang 5). Instead of teaching students, teachers will assign hanzi as homework. Some teachers may not always have the resources or time to reinforce the concepts during class time, Additionally, it is nearly accepted by all teachers that a “critical mass” of characters must be accumulated before anything may be done with them (5), so this method encourages acquiring that “critical mass” first and learning and reinforcing patterns later. 

This project, at the moment, employs the fourth approach, allowing students full freedom to explore their own educational needs without the weighing down of unnecessary or perhaps obstructive features such as lists of flashcards, which might be unwieldy or unnecessary. 
Additionally, some users may be only be seeking a quick fulfillment of a temporary curiosity as opposed to using this application as a classroom supplement.
