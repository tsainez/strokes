# Strokes

## TODO
This application is a work in progress, and multiple features are planned for development.
- Dark mode compatability
- Practice sets, where users can practice a customizable set of selected characters in succession. 
- Character completion progress indicators. 
- Developer information page. 
- Automatically resets character after completion, instead of waiting for user input to reset, so that characters may be practiced in quick succession. Especially important for low stroke number characters. 
- Make stroke order data local and allow for usage without WiFi access. *Requires editing licensing.* 
- Look into adding [furigana](https://stackoverflow.com/questions/47228739/display-japanese-furigana-in-uilabel).
