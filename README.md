# Strokes
Strokes is a simple iOS application that lets users practice the correct stroke orders for certain Chinese characters. This application was created as part of a senior project done at Dr. TJ Owens Gilroy Early College Academy. This Github repository hosts all the source code as well as the development process for the product of that project. This product was created with several months worth of academic research done in mind.

## Features
This application seeks to deliver the utmost utility to the user without sacrificing any aesthetics. 
- Search for any Chinese character, traditional or simplified, and practice writing the stroke order of that character.

##  Design Philosophy
Taken from a [research essay](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1TwgbuK-8-ppUrBhht5tVHbNseRh-REsJ3P_DQm03PIM/edit?usp=sharing) I did on Chinese writing systems and the philosophies that Chinese as a foreign language teachers employ,

> Some teachers opt to not teach Hanzi whatsoever, believing that “hanzi must be internalized by learners themselves, a task that must be tackled through individual effort and rote memorization.” Instead of teaching students, teachers will assign hanzi as homework. Some teachers may not always have the resources or time to reinforce the concepts during class time, Additionally, it is nearly accepted by all teachers that a “critical mass” of characters must be accumulated before anything may be done with them, so this method encourages acquiring that “critical mass” first and learning and reinforcing patterns later. 

This is, in essence, the design philosophy that guided the development of this application for 8 months. 

## Planned Features
This application is a work in progress, and multiple features are planned for development.
- Practice sets, where users can practice a customizable set of selected characters in succession. 
- Character completion progress indicators. 
- Developer information page. 
- Automatically resets character after completion, instead of waiting for user input to reset, so that characters may be practiced in quick succession. Especially important for low stroke number characters.
